These are for the OpenWRT implementation:
- Implement the patches that are in OpenWRT.  There are currently 4 patches:
 1- 010-dont-add-host-paths-in-config.in.patch
 2- 020-change-p2p-tosmtp.patch
 3- 030-gcc10.patch
 4- 040-64bit-time-t-patch

These patches are mostly required for the compilation and running properly in OpenWRT
(patches 010 and 030)

- Cleanup the code.  The code is not pretty clean and can use some cleaning to make it more
  readable

- Implement IPv6 tarcking.  For this code from another instance of bandwidthd can be used:
  https://github.com/neatbasis/bandwidthd 

- Implement storing the data in a MariaDB (mysql) database to improve flexibility.
  This is in addition to the Postgresql and SQLite databases

- Cleanup the PHP code to declare variables.

These are what was in the TODO from NethServer.  This may never be implemented.
Move output modules to forked section
Config switches for sample intervals and graphing ranges

# Features requested by people, I make a note of them here in case myself
# or someone else wants to come along and implement them.
List of IP's to exclude from the page
Switch to hide all ip addresses

Switch to only graph traffic not to and from the local network (internet
	traffic only)

Change ram datastore:  Linked lists with identifiers that store only non-zero traffic, use
	longs for traffic storage instead of long longs and implement a multiplyer field.
	will allow implementation of custom ports to graph and reduce ram usage by 70%ish
